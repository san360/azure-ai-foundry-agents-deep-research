# Orca Intelligence and Communication: A 2025 Scientific Overview

## Orca Cognitive Abilities and Intelligence

Killer whales (orcas) are widely recognized as highly intelligent marine mammals. In fact, modern cetaceans like orcas possess the neurobiological hallmarks of complex minds – including large brains (up to 6.8 kg), an expanded and intricately folded neocortex, and an elaborated limbic (emotional) system – that provide the foundation for sophisticated cognition and rich emotional lives,<sup>3</sup>. Research on orca behavior and neuroanatomy has revealed numerous indicators of their intelligence:

1. **Problem-Solving and Learning:** Orcas demonstrate remarkable problem-solving abilities and learning through both innovation and social transmission. In the wild, different orca populations have invented specialized hunting techniques and passed them down through generations. For example, some orcas in Patagonia intentionally strand themselves on beaches to snatch seals, while Antarctic orcas cooperatively create waves to wash seals off ice floes. Such *learned* tactics exemplify orca ingenuity. In captivity, orcas have even devised their own tricks: one young orca at a marine park figured out how to regurgitate fish to lure seagulls, then ambush them – a clever bait-and-catch strategy. This novel feeding trick did not remain unique; the orca’s tank-mates were observed watching and then adopting the same tactic, indicating **cultural learning** of an innovation<sup>4</sup>. Biologists noted that the behavior spread to multiple individuals “in exactly the way that cultures do in humans”<sup>4</sup>. Orcas are also highly trainable and capable of generalizing learned behaviors. Studies in 2022 taught captive orcas an “innovate” command – effectively asking them to perform a brand-new behavior on cue – and found the animals could indeed come up with novel actions or variations, underscoring their behavioral flexibility and creativity<sup>8</sup>. These examples show that orcas can solve problems through both individual insight and by observing and imitating others.

2. **Memory and Self-Awareness:** Field observations and experiments suggest orcas have excellent long-term memory and possibly self-recognition. In one notable case, a captive orca named Lolita (captured in the 1970s) still uses the distinct calls of her natal pod decades later<sup>5</sup>, implying she remembers the “language” of her family even after years of isolation. More generally, orcas rely on memory to navigate vast home ranges and to return to traditional feeding grounds or salmon runs annually, guided in part by the knowledge of elder pod members<sup>3</sup>. Scientifically, orcas have also shown *self-awareness* in mirror tests. In a controlled study, orcas exhibited **contingency checking** (testing whether a mirror image moves with them) and even passed the “mark test” by inspecting themselves when given a temporary mark, suggesting that they recognize the image as self. Like their dolphin cousins, killer whales therefore appear to possess the cognitive capacity for self-recognition. This is a hallmark of higher intelligence. Neuroanatomy provides further support: orca brains are highly gyrified (folded) – in fact, *more* folded than human brains – which allows for rapid processing and storage of information<sup>5</sup>. Scientists have identified enlarged structures in the orca brain associated with learning and memory (e.g. an expanded hippocampal region and limbic lobe). These findings align with orcas’ observed ability to remember complex social relationships and sounds over many years.

3. **Complex Social Structures and Culture:** Orca societies are among the most complex in the animal kingdom, often compared to those of primates. They live in tightly bonded family groups (pods) centered on maternal lines – offspring (even adult males) typically remain with their mothers for life. Multiple related pods that share an ancestor form clans with their own **cultural traditions**, such as distinctive vocal dialects and hunting practices. Social network analysis has shown that orcas form strong preferential bonds; a 2021 study found their social relationships and even clique structures are strikingly similar to those of humans and chimps, including lifelong “friendships” between certain individuals,. Field researchers observed, for instance, two young male orcas (only distantly related) who were almost always seen together, mirroring the way human friends preferentially associate. Researchers did not hesitate to use the word **“friendship”** for such bonds. Orcas also exhibit cooperative behavior and role specialization within pods. They coordinate during group hunts with near-military precision – encircling prey, communicating positions, and attacking in unison – tactics that imply planning and teamwork. These behaviors are learned and refined socially: mothers and other experienced individuals actively teach younger orcas hunting skills by example. There is clear cultural transmission of knowledge. Different orca populations have distinct diets and techniques (for example, one population specializes in hunting sharks and only eats the nutrient-rich livers, while another focuses on salmon and ignores other fish). Such differences are *culturally maintained* rather than genetic, meeting the scientific criteria for **animal culture**. Perhaps the most charming evidence of orca culture comes from observed **fads** – spontaneous behaviors that spread socially and then fade. In the 1980s, one Pacific Northwest pod started carrying dead salmon on their heads like hats; the behavior quickly caught on in at least two other pods, then disappeared the next year. Orcas have even been seen engaging in ritualized social gatherings. When pods meet after separation, they perform unique “greeting ceremonies” in which two lines of orcas converge and mingle with exuberant physical contact. All these behaviors point to a complex social life in which group-specific traditions, cooperation, play, and social learning are key – hallmarks of advanced intelligence.

4. **Emotions and Empathy:** Mounting evidence suggests orcas experience a range of emotions and may be capable of empathy and grief. A famously poignant example occurred in 2018, when a female orca (nicknamed Tahlequah) gave birth to a calf that died shortly after birth. Rather than abandon the carcass, the mother orca kept it afloat and carried it with her for **17 days**, over a distance of about 1,000 miles. Scientists from the Center for Whale Research described it as a “tour of grief”. This touching vigil suggests a level of maternal grief and social bonding similar to humans. Moreover, researchers have documented numerous instances of whales and dolphins (including orcas) supporting sick or injured pod mates, even sharing food with them<sup>3</sup>. Orcas have been seen propping up weakened companions to help them breathe, and in one case, a pod helped an injured juvenile by bringing it food until it recovered<sup>3</sup>. Such altruistic caregiving indicates empathy and strong social affection. Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) notes that “mourning behaviors” – adults carrying or staying with deceased young – have been observed in many cetacean species and are likely common among these long-lived, social mammals. Historically, scientists were cautious about attributing human-like emotions to animals, **“reluctant to use words like ‘grief’ for fear of projecting human emotions”**. However, the consistency of these observations has led many experts to acknowledge that orcas and their kin have an emotional dimension to their lives. Neuroscience reinforces this: orcas have brain cells called **spindle neurons** (von Economo neurons) involved in social emotion and empathy – cells once thought unique to humans and great apes<sup>6</sup>. In fact, orcas and other large whales have spindle neurons in comparable brain areas as humans, potentially in even greater numbers, likely as an evolutionary response to complex social living<sup>6</sup>. Furthermore, MRI studies show an orca’s limbic lobe (the brain region governing emotions and memory) is massively enlarged and even contains structures (additional paralimbic clefts) that humans lack. Scientists believe this indicates an orca’s capacity for emotional processing may be highly advanced<sup>5</sup>,. In summary, both behavior and biology point to orcas as emotionally sophisticated beings.

*(In addition to the above, orcas have impressive sensory and cognitive adaptations. Their **echolocation** ability – emitting clicks and interpreting the echoes – is so refined that they can detect the shape and texture of objects and even discern species of fish by the unique echo signatures of swim bladders<sup>3</sup>. This sensory intelligence enables them to make complex judgments about their environment. Overall, researchers agree that killer whales “should now be recognised as unique individuals, communities, societies and cultures and valued as such”<sup>1</sup>.*) 

## Orca Communication and Language

Orcas are highly acoustic animals, relying on sound for communication and navigation in the underwater world. They **do not have vocal cords**; instead, they produce sounds by moving air through nasal passages near the blowhole, using structures called phonic lips. Despite this different anatomy, orcas are capable of a stunning variety of vocalizations. Scientists classify orca sounds into a few broad categories – **clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls**<sup>2</sup>:

- **Vocalization Repertoire and Patterns:** The orca’s sound repertoire serves diverse purposes. **Echolocation clicks** are very rapid, sonar-like clicks used to “see” the environment and pinpoint prey; these can be emitted in high-speed trains of sound and are among the loudest sounds orcas make. They also produce **whistles** – continuous, tone-like calls – and numerous types of **pulsed calls**, which are modulated bursts of sound. Pulsed calls (sometimes described as discrete calls) are the primary social signals orcas use to communicate with each other. Each call type has a distinctive pattern of pitches and pulses; biologists have identified dozens of call types within some populations. Orca vocalizations span frequencies from a few hundred hertz (for some calls) up to ultrasonic range in the case of echolocation clicks. Many calls are loud and traveling long distances underwater. Notably, orcas are capable of **biphonation**, producing two tones simultaneously (thought to be achieved by using both sets of phonic lips)<sup>2</sup>. Researchers applying network analysis and machine learning to orca calls have been able to objectively classify similar call types and discern subtle variations<sup>2</sup>. This rich acoustic repertoire indicates that orcas have a complex *signaling system*. Certain call types appear to be associated with specific behaviors or contexts (for instance, distinct calls are sometimes heard during socializing vs. foraging), though we are just beginning to understand these associations.

- **Dialects and Vocal Learning:** Among the most fascinating aspects of orca communication is that **each pod has its own dialect** of calls. Much like regional accents or dialects in human language, orca pods and family groups develop unique suites of call types. The differences are striking enough that researchers can often tell which pod or population they are listening to simply from the calls heard on a hydrophone,. In the well-studied orcas of the Northeast Pacific, for example, the resident orcas have been classified into acoustic clans – extended family groups that share some calls. Each **matriline** within a clan may have slight variants of those calls, akin to sub-dialects. These vocal traditions are **stable over generations** and are not genetically determined; calves learn the calls of their family as they grow up. In fact, orcas are exceptionally adept **vocal learners** – an ability relatively rare among mammals. They can imitate novel sounds and even the calls of other species, indicating a flexibility to learn “foreign” languages. A stunning case in 2014 documented that several orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins began to modify their calls to resemble the dolphin’s whistles and clicks. The orcas essentially learned elements of the dolphins’ vocalizations after living together for some time. Scientists interpret this as social accommodation – the orcas were *intentionally* matching the dolphins’ sounds, which underscores their capacity to learn new vocal patterns through imitation. Perhaps the most famous demonstration of orca vocal learning occurred in 2018, when researchers trained a captive female orca, **Wikie**, to mimic a variety of unfamiliar sounds on command. Astonishingly, Wikie quickly reproduced **human words** like “hello” and “bye-bye,” as well as other animal noises, with recognizably accurate intonation,. She sometimes succeeded on the first attempt and could even repeat counting (“one, two”) in a distorted orca voice. While Wikie likely did not understand the meaning, this experiment proved that orcas can **control their vocal output** to copy sounds outside their natural repertoire. Such **open-ended vocal learning** is a key prerequisite for true language and is rare outside humans and some birds. The fact that wild orcas maintain dialects implies that they *actively learn and culturally transmit* their communication signals,<sup>7</sup>. Each pod’s dialect strengthens group identity – an orca can probably recognize if another individual is from its community or an outside group just by voice. Dialects and vocal learning in orcas are often cited as evidence of whale **culture** and social complexity.

- **Communication Structure and Potential Syntax:** A central question in orca research is how much of their communication has language-like structure or rules. Orca calls do not appear to form infinite combinations in the way human words do, but researchers have observed structured patterns. Sequences of orca calls can convey information about group movements, emotional states, or activities, though scientists are still deciphering the “code.” Intriguingly, recent quantitative studies suggest that whale communication follows certain **linguistic principles of efficiency** similar to human language. A 2025 study analyzed vocal sequences across 16 whale species (including orcas) and found many conform to laws like **Menzerath’s law**, where longer sequences are composed of shorter repeating units , . In other words, orcas and other whales tend to “compress” information: when they make longer series of sounds, each component call tends to be relatively brief, as if optimizing the sequence length . Orcas were observed to compress their call sequences (using shorter elements when stringing many calls together) . This statistical pattern is similar to human languages, which often use shorter words in longer phrases (a principle of efficiency). Another linguistic rule, **Zipf’s law of abbreviation** (common signals are shorter), has been found in the songs of some great whales . However, the same study noted that orcas did **not** shorten the internal structure of calls that are used more frequently , implying their communication efficiency follows some but not all human linguistic patterns. These findings hint that orca vocal communication has a *measurable structure* and efficiency-driven evolution, even if it may not constitute a full-fledged grammar. Past work on humpback whales famously showed their songs have a hierarchical structure (phrases repeated in themes), but those songs are likely reproductive displays rather than conversations. In the case of orcas’ social calls, researchers have detected repeated sequences and combinations that might function like phrases or signals (for example, a sequence of three specific calls might occur during reunion ceremonies). That said, **no definitive syntax or semantic “vocabulary” has been decoded** in orca communication yet – a topic of active debate. Orcas clearly convey identity (who they are) and possibly intent or context (e.g. “let’s hunt” versus “I’m playful”) through calls, but whether they can relay detailed information or novel messages (a key property of language) remains unproven. Some experts argue the term *“language”* is not fully applicable, preferring to call it a complex communication system, while others point to the rich, learned and context-dependent nature of orca vocalizations as being language-like. What is evident is that orcas have **structured, meaningful exchanges** within their social groups – we just haven’t translated them yet.

- **Information Sharing and Function of Calls:** Observations indicate that orcas use vocalizations to coordinate and maintain their social and survival activities. For instance, when cooperating during a hunt for schooling fish, orcas emit series of clicks and calls that seem to coordinate the pod’s movements to herd the fish—effectively acting as instructions or signals to synchronize actions. Similarly, when separate groups meet, they exchange a flurry of calls (each side vocalizing their pod-specific calls) as if to announce themselves and reaffirm social bonds. Researchers have noted that certain **contact calls** are used to keep a pod together when traveling in poor visibility or over long distances; these calls function like a “rallying call” or a check-in (“I’m here, where are you?”) among dispersed members. Mother orcas with new calves have been heard using very soft, close-range calls, possibly to avoid attracting predators like sharks or mammal-eating orcas while still keeping the calf close by – a form of whispering communication adapted for secrecy<sup>7</sup>. Another critical use of vocalizations is in **teaching and social learning**: adult females have been observed making particular sequences of sounds when demonstrating hunting techniques to juveniles, suggesting these sounds might facilitate learning or signal the type of prey being pursued. Calls also play a role in maintaining complex social hierarchies and relationships. A recent line of research is examining if certain vocal signals correlate with social behaviors like reunions, confrontations, or affectionate interactions. For example, scientists are investigating whether there are specific sound patterns consistently heard when different matrilines split apart or join together, or when orcas share food after a kill<sup>7</sup>. All of this points to vocalizations carrying context-dependent information. Additionally, orcas seem quite aware of **when to be loud or quiet**. Fish-eating orcas (whose prey cannot hear their frequency range well) are vocally chatty while foraging, but orcas that hunt marine mammals (which *can* hear orca calls) often travel in stealth mode, remaining nearly silent to avoid tipping off their seals or porpoise prey. This behavioral adjustment implies orcas understand the *effect* of their communication on others – essentially using silence as a strategy, which is itself a form of informational behavior. Overall, orcas use sound to share information about *who* they are (identity and pod affiliation), *where* they are, and *what* they are doing or about to do. The full “dictionary” of orca calls is still unknown, but ongoing research is linking more vocalizations to specific meanings or functions. Scientists emphasize that we have **only scratched the surface** of understanding how these calls function in orcas’ decision-making and social life<sup>7</sup>. Cutting-edge projects are now deploying synchronized drone video and underwater microphones to observe what specific vocal signals might mean in real time (for example, matching a particular call type to a cooperative hunting maneuver or a social interaction)<sup>7</sup>. Through these efforts, we hope to unravel how orcas share information and how nuanced their “language” may be.

## Recent Findings and Ongoing Debates (2020–2025)

In the last few years, research on orca intelligence and communication has accelerated, yielding new insights and sparking debate in the scientific community. Below are some of the notable **recent findings and discussions**:

- **Social Learning Fads and “Orca Uprising” Tales:** Beginning in 2020, a strange trend emerged off the coasts of Spain and Portugal – orcas started interacting with sailing boats, occasionally even damaging rudders and, in a few cases, sinking small yachts. This behavior, initially perplexing to scientists, is now thought to be another example of orca social learning in action. Evidence suggests it began after a likely traumatizing encounter between one female orca (nicknamed “White Gladis”) and a boat, after which she and several others started approaching and hitting vessels,. Over the next couple of years, juveniles in her pod imitated the behavior, and it spread to become a minor **fad** in that subpopulation,. Experts like Dr. Luke Rendell emphasize that there’s no obvious *adaptive* benefit (the orcas do not gain food or protection by disabling boats), which suggests this is **social play or exploration** rather than purposeful aggression,. In fact, orcas have a history of pick-up “hobbies” – from wearing salmon on their heads to seemingly playful interactions with buoys – that arise and dissipate, much like human trends. The boat-attacking behavior fits this pattern and appears to be transmitted through **social learning** (young orcas observing and copying elders). It remains a hotly debated topic what the orcas’ motivation is: theories range from curiosity and play, to a form of revenge or warning triggered by past negative boat encounters. Some observers have dramatically framed it as orcas “teaching each other to fight back” against human vessels. Scientists caution that we **cannot conclusively read the orcas’ intentions** – notions of collective “revenge” or solidarity, while *plausible speculation*, are not proved,. What this episode has done is fuel discussion about orca intelligence: it shows orcas can rapidly spread novel behaviors culturally (even ones that mystify humans), and it forces us to consider how we manage human–orca interactions. The debate has even entered ethical realms: if orcas continue the boat bumping, do we adapt our boating practices or attempt to deter or harm the orcas? Researchers note that historically humans would opt to control animals seen as a threat, but given orcas’ protected status and our growing respect for their intelligence, there is public hesitance to take lethal measures,. This ongoing situation in the 2020s highlights both the **capabilities** of orcas (organized behavior spread through learning) and the challenges of coexisting with another intelligent, strategic predator.

- **Advances in Decoding Orca Communication:** Technological leaps are enabling scientists to probe orca communication more deeply than ever before. **Artificial intelligence and big data** have become allies in the quest to understand what orcas are saying. In 2025, a collaboration between the Raincoast Conservation Foundation and the Earth Species Project launched a pilot study in the Pacific Northwest that uses machine learning to analyze orca calls in parallel with drone video of the whales’ behavior<sup>7</sup>. By aligning specific vocalizations with observed actions, interactions, and even environmental conditions, researchers aim to build a “Rosetta stone” for orca language. The project leaders, Dr. Valeria Vergara and Dr. Lance Barrett-Lennard, explained that despite decades of research on orca acoustics, *we still do not know the meaning of most calls*, especially in complex social contexts<sup>7</sup>. Questions like “How do orcas coordinate a hunt using sound?” or “Do orcas have a call to share food?” remain open<sup>7</sup>. The use of AI can detect patterns too subtle for humans to notice, potentially revealing a kind of **syntax** or predictive structure in sequences of calls<sup>7</sup>. Early efforts are promising: algorithms can already classify call types and are starting to hint at correlations (for example, a particular call might consistently precede a group dive or a change in travel direction). The aforementioned 2025 study by Mason Youngblood, published in *Science Advances*, is another breakthrough in understanding whale communication structure, showing that orca call sequences obey patterns of efficiency similarly found in human language , . These findings have stirred debate about whether such patterns qualify as evidence of true linguistic properties, or simply reflect general principles of optimized communication in nature. Some linguists argue that **language** in the human sense requires a open-ended vocabulary and grammar, which orcas have not demonstrated; others point out that orcas have **cultural dialects, vocal learning, and possibly structural rules**, which are all language-like traits. The discussion has shifted from *“Do orcas have language?”* towards *“To what extent *and in what ways* is orca communication language-like?”*. As of 2025, scientists remain cautious but intrigued – the consensus is that orca communication is highly complex and likely carries significant meaning, but more evidence is needed to determine its syntax and semantic richness.

- **Deepening Understanding of Orca Social Cognition:** New behavioral studies continue to illuminate just how sophisticated orca minds are. The 2021 study on orca social bonds (cited earlier) not only confirmed that orcas have preferred friends, but it also found their social network dynamics (who associates with whom, how often) are mathematically analogous to those of primate societies. This adds to a body of literature suggesting convergent evolution of intelligence and social complexity in cetaceans and primates<sup>6</sup>. Furthermore, research on captive orcas’ cognitive skills show they can understand concepts and improvise. For instance, apart from the creativity-on-cue study (Manitzas-Hill et al. 2022) demonstrating innovative behavior, trainers have noted that orcas can learn **abstract rules**. One anecdote describes orcas being trained to differentiate “same vs different” with objects – a task requiring conceptual thought often used in animal cognition tests. Orcas mastered it readily, indicating they grasp abstract concepts. There is also ongoing debate about the impact of captivity on orca cognition: some researchers argue that the stereotyped, simplified environment under-stimulates these intelligent creatures, potentially underestimating their abilities in experiments, while others note that certain cognitive tests can only be done in controlled settings. The ethical debate over keeping orcas in marine parks reached a turning point in recent years, influenced by scientific recognition of their intelligence and emotional depth. By 2025, several countries (and one U.S. state) have outlawed orca captivity, and SeaWorld has ended its orca breeding program, acknowledging that such smart, socially complex animals do not thrive in concrete tanks<sup>3</sup>. This shift was driven in part by research into stress and brain health in captive orcas, which revealed symptoms of psychological trauma. In one study, neuroscientist Lori Marino and colleagues concluded that orcas’ enlarged limbic systems and neocortex – the very features that make them capable of complex thought and feeling – also make them vulnerable to suffering in impoverished environments. The scientific community largely agrees that an orca’s cognitive and social needs are immense, and this perspective fuels ongoing discussions about providing sanctuaries for retired captive orcas.

- **Are Orcas “Persons”?** Finally, an overarching debate inspired by all these findings is whether orcas (and other great cetaceans) should be considered **non-human persons** with certain rights. Philosophers and scientists note that orcas check many of the boxes for personhood: self-awareness, intelligence, complex language-like communication, social bonds, culture, and emotional sophistication. In 2013, a group of neuroscientists pointed out that orcas have brain structures analogous to the human speech center and an immensely developed limbic lobe, positing that they have “many human-like qualities including intelligence, language, and an exquisite sense of emotional capability”,. They argued that these capacities entitle orcas to a moral consideration similar to that we give to great apes or humans. While not everyone is comfortable with the term “person” for an animal, there is growing consensus that orcas are *individuals* in the biological and psychological sense. International bodies have begun to discuss the cultural significance of cetaceans; for example, UNESCO scientists have suggested that unique whale and dolphin cultures (like the song traditions of sperm whales or the prey-specific dialects of orcas) are an intangible heritage worth protecting. As of 2025 this remains more a moral and legal debate than a settled scientific matter, but it clearly stems from the scientific discoveries about orca minds and societies.

**In summary,** our understanding of orcas has evolved dramatically in recent decades – from seeing them as simply large predators to appreciating them as sentient, intelligent beings with complex social lives and communication systems. Orcas exhibit problem-solving savvy, long memories, self-recognition, intricate family bonds, and emotional depth. They “speak” to each other in dialects and possibly follow communicative rules that parallel aspects of human language, even if we have yet to decode their full meaning. Ongoing research (aided by new technology) is bringing us closer to grasping how orcas perceive their world and share information with one another. There are active debates about just how language-like orca communication is, and what level of consciousness or rights these animals should be accorded, but there is little doubt in the scientific community that orcas are among the most cognitively advanced creatures on the planet<sup>6</sup>. As one researcher eloquently put it, the study of killer whales continually “**challenges the idea that we’re the only intelligent species on the planet**,” inviting us to expand our understanding of intelligence itself<sup>5</sup>. Each new finding – from spindle cells in their brains to shared cultural fads – further cements the view of orcas as extraordinary beings with minds well worth our continued exploration and protection.

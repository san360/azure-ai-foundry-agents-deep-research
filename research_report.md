# Orca Intelligence and Communication: Current Research Insights

## Introduction  
   *A killer whale (orca) surfacing in the Pacific.* Orcas (Orcinus orca), often called killer whales, are not only apex predators but also **one of the most intelligent marine mammals**. As the largest members of the dolphin family, they are found in all oceans and exhibit remarkably complex behaviors and social structures<sup>8</sup>. Scientists have long been fascinated by orcas’ cognitive abilities and their sophisticated communication systems, sometimes likened to a form of **language**. Recent studies – especially those in the past few years – have deepened our understanding of orcas’ brains, social lives, and vocalizations. This report reviews the current state of research on orca intelligence and “language,” highlighting key discoveries about their **brain structure, cognitive capabilities, social culture,** and **vocal communication**, including advances from post-2020 research.

## Brain Structure and Cognitive Abilities  
Orcas possess an **exceptionally large and complex brain**. Weighing up to about 15 pounds (≈7 kg), an orca’s brain is the second-largest of any ocean mammal (after sperm whales). Size alone isn’t the only remarkable feature – the orca brain is highly folded (convoluted), indicating an expansive **neocortex** associated with advanced cognition, conscious thought, and even self-awareness. Neuroanatomy studies have revealed specialized neural adaptations: for example, orcas (and other dolphins) have **spindle neurons** – cells linked to advanced capacities like recognizing, remembering, and problem-solving<sup>4</sup>. They also have an exceptionally developed **limbic system** (emotion-processing region) and a unique *paralimbic lobe* not found in humans. This paralimbic area is believed to support complex social cognition and acoustic processing, underscoring how orcas evolved to live and communicate in rich social environments. Notably, the portion of the orca brain involved in emotions is even **more elaborate than ours**, reflecting the rich emotional lives required by their intricate social bonds<sup>4,15</sup>. Neuroscientists like Lori Marino have pointed out that cetaceans even have a *double* auditory cortex – two separate pathways for sound in the brain – suggesting they perform very complex sound analysis that we are only beginning to fathom<sup>5</sup>.

Such brain power manifests in many **cognitive feats** observed in orcas. Research indicates that orcas rank alongside primates and elephants in tests of memory, self-recognition, and learning. For instance, orcas have demonstrated **self-awareness** by passing the mirror test – when presented with a mirror, they exhibit behaviors indicating they recognize the reflection as themselves, a hallmark of higher cognition<sup>8</sup>,. In both wild and captive settings, orcas show **problem-solving skills** and creativity. They often devise intricate hunting strategies that imply planning and cooperation (discussed more below), and have even been seen using rudimentary **tool use**: a famous example is a young orca in a marine park that learned to regurgitate fish to lure seagulls within reach, then taught this trick to its peers. Such behaviors highlight **innovation and social learning**. Orcas also appear to understand cause-and-effect and can learn by imitation. In captivity, they’ve solved puzzles and manipulated objects, sometimes pausing as if to **consider their approach**, rather than relying purely on trial-and-error. This suggests a degree of **metacognition** – awareness of their own thought process – enabling them to adjust strategies and achieve goals efficiently. Overall, the combination of an advanced brain and real-world demonstrations of learning, imitation, and problem-solving firmly establish orcas as **highly intelligent** beings<sup>8</sup>.

## Complex Social Structures and Culture  
Orcas live in **tightly knit family groups** and have one of the most stable social structures known among non-humans. They typically organize into pods centered on matrilineal lines – often led by an **older female (matriarch)** who can be grandmother to several generations<sup>8</sup>,. Remarkably, offspring (both sons and daughters) often stay with their mother for life, resulting in multi-generational pods containing up to four or five generations of relatives. This long-term social cohesion has even resulted in orcas evolving menopause: females stop reproducing in their 30s-40s but can live well into their 80s or 90s, remaining important leaders in the pod,. Research has shown that these **post-reproductive grandmothers** significantly increase the survival of their grandcalves by sharing food and critical knowledge – for example, memory of when and where to find scarce prey,. This “**grandmother effect**” in orcas, confirmed by a 36-year study published in 2019, helps explain why orcas (like humans and only a few other species) evolved long post-reproductive lifespans,.

Within these family groups, orcas develop **rich social traditions and cultures**. Different populations (or ecotypes) of orcas exhibit unique behaviors, diets, and even “customs” that are learned and passed down through generations,<sup>8</sup>. Scientists now recognize these as true **animal cultures**, meeting the same criteria as human cultural behaviors. For example, *transient* orcas in one region specialize in hunting marine mammals and typically remain silent to avoid alerting their prey, whereas *resident* orcas in the same waters feed on fish and are much more vocal<sup>11</sup>. These feeding specializations are not genetic but learned – calves adopt the diet and techniques of their group. Astonishingly, orcas in different parts of the world have invented distinct hunting strategies tailored to local prey. Newly documented traditions include: 

- **Beach Hunting:** In Patagonia, orcas have learned to surge onto shore to snatch sea lion pups, timing the waves to safely beach and then slide back into the water. This risky technique is taught by experienced adults to younger pod members.  
- **Ray Flipping:** In New Zealand, orcas specialize in hunting stingrays by flipping them upside-down to induce tonic immobility (paralyzing the ray),. This clever exploit of prey physiology again appears to be a learned, shared tactic.  
- **“Salmon Hats” Game:** In the Pacific Northwest, a quirky fad was observed where orcas draped dead salmon on their heads like hats. First recorded in the 1980s, this play behavior spread across multiple pods (J, K, and L pods of the Southern Residents) over a summer<sup>15</sup>. Decades later in 2024, researchers documented the behavior resurfacing in at least one individual, suggesting such cultural fads can be remembered or reinvented<sup>15</sup>. It’s speculated to be a form of play or social display when food is abundant<sup>15</sup>.  
- **Seagull Baiting:** In a marine park in Canada, an orca invented a trick to lure birds – spitting regurgitated fish onto the water’s surface to attract seagulls, then ambushing them. This ingenious behavior was then copied by other orcas in the same enclosure. Scientists hailed it as evidence of **cultural transmission**, since the technique spread socially among the orcas,.

Such traditions underscore that orcas aren’t just acting on instinct; they **learn from each other and even deliberately teach**. Field observations show adults slowing down or exaggerating movements during hunts when calves are present, effectively creating teaching moments for the young. In some cases, adults have been seen releasing injured prey for juveniles to practice hunting – a clear demonstration of **intentional teaching**. The existence of distinct dialects (discussed below), feeding habits, and social rituals among pods has led researchers to identify different “cultural units” or communities of orcas<sup>8</sup>. As one scientist put it, *“Orcas have both geographic and social dialects. They lead complex social lives, with multi-generational cultural traditions.”*<sup>13</sup> These multi-layered societies also involve complex relationship dynamics. Orcas form strong lifelong bonds; they cooperate in raising young and sometimes form alliances between pods. There is even evidence of behaviors akin to **alliance formation and reconciliation** after conflict, implying a high degree of social intelligence needed to navigate orca society. Moreover, orcas have been observed engaging in **empathetic or grieving behaviors**. In a famous 2018 case, a female orca (nicknamed Tahlequah, J35 of the Southern Residents) carried her dead newborn calf for 17 days and over 1,000 miles, an event researchers interpreted as a poignant display of grief<sup>12,15</sup>. Such episodes, along with routine affectionate behaviors, suggest profound emotional depth and social awareness in orcas – likely supported by their enlarged limbic and insular brain regions associated with emotion and empathy.

## Vocal Communication and Language-Like Systems  
One of the most extraordinary aspects of orca society is their **sophisticated communication system**. Orcas are a highly vocal species, and they rely on sound for social interaction, navigation, and hunting. They produce a wide repertoire of sounds, broadly classified into **clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls**<sup>11</sup>:

- **Echolocation Clicks:** Rapid clicking sounds used like sonar to navigate and locate prey. Orcas, like bats, echolocate by emitting clicks and listening for echoes – their brains even have doubled auditory pathways likely to process these echoes with extreme precision<sup>2,5</sup>. Clicks are typically used in hunting or orientation.  
- **Whistles:** Tonal, whistle-like sounds, often used in close-range or intimate social contexts (for many dolphin species whistles are key social calls). Orcas do use whistles socially, though less frequently than their other calls<sup>11</sup>. Some whistles may serve specific functions like contact calls within a group.  
- **Pulsed Calls (Discrete Calls):** These are the most prominent orca vocalizations – loud, patterned calls lasting ~0.5–2 seconds, with distinct harmonic structures. Each orca group has a unique *repertoire of discrete calls*, sometimes described as their dialect<sup>11</sup>. Pulsed calls can sound like squeals, squawks, honks, or trumpets to human ears<sup>13</sup>. Biologists catalog these calls with alphanumeric labels (e.g. call “S1” for a particular pod)<sup>11</sup>.

Researchers discovered decades ago that **each pod or family of orcas has its own dialect** – a specific set of call types that is largely unique to that group<sup>13</sup>. In the Pacific Northwest, for example, the Southern Resident community’s pods (J, K, and L pod) share some calls but also have distinctive ones that allow scientists (and likely the whales themselves) to tell the pods apart by sound<sup>11</sup>. These dialects are **socially learned** and passed down through generations, not genetically inherited<sup>10</sup>. In other words, orca calves learn their “language” from their mother and close kin just as human children pick up the language of their family. Importantly, different orca ecotypes not only have different diets but also **different vocal dialects**, essentially corresponding to their culture<sup>2,16</sup>. John K. B. Ford’s pioneering studies in the 1980s first confirmed this, showing that orcas have **geographically distinct and clan-specific dialects** with up to 17 discrete call types in a given family repertoire<sup>13</sup>. These vocal traditions can remain stable over many decades<sup>13</sup>. Ford and others consider these dialects part of orca **culture**, as they form an acoustic identity for the group and facilitate social bonding<sup>2,13</sup>.

Beyond dialect differences, scientists are investigating just how complex orca communication is – **do orcas have something comparable to language?** Orca calls are certainly rich in information. Many calls are used in specific contexts (for example, certain calls during foraging vs. traveling), though interestingly, calls are not one-to-one signals with simple meanings. Recent reviews note that most calls are *too complex to be tied to a single context or meaning*; their usage can be nuanced and overlapping. This suggests orca communication doesn’t consist of a simple “word = object” dictionary, but rather a flexible, context-dependent vocal system. Orcas can also combine calls into sequences. A **2023 study** of Icelandic killer whales provided new insight by showing that the sequences of calls they produce are non-random – certain call types follow each other more often than expected by chance . Using algorithms (Markov models on hours of recorded call data), researchers found **repetitive patterns and preferred call combinations**, indicating orcas may organize calls into structured sequences or phrases . This kind of structure is a step toward syntax, akin to a very simple grammar. Indeed, some scientists hypothesize that orca vocalizations have **combinatorial rules or “proto-grammar”**, meaning they might combine sounds to convey more complex messages (for example, repeating a call or blending two calls could alter meaning). While full “semantic language” in the human sense isn’t confirmed, evidence is mounting that orca communication is far more intricate than a series of instinctual cries. One ambitious 2023 project applied machine learning to orca calls and reported being able to **predict the orcas’ behaviors from their vocalizations with about 96% accuracy**<sup>1</sup>. This implies that specific call patterns correlate strongly with certain activities or contexts – in other words, the sounds carry information about what the whales are doing or about to do. The authors suggested this is **evidence of semantic communication**, meaning the calls likely encode meaningful signals about behavior (for example, calls associated with hunting, resting, socializing, etc.)<sup>1</sup>. It’s an exciting hint that we might one day decode an orca “lexicon” of sorts.

One key factor enabling such complexity is that orcas are superb **vocal learners**. Unlike most mammals, they can learn new sounds throughout life and even imitate noises from other species. Captive orcas have been recorded mimicking human words like “hello” and “bye-bye” after hearing trainers say them<sup>6,10</sup>. In a controlled study, a 14-year-old female orca named Wikie successfully copied several novel sounds on command – some were random whale sounds she hadn’t heard before, and others were human words. Spectrogram analyses showed her imitations matched the originals closely in waveform<sup>10</sup>. This experiment, published in 2018, was the first proof that orcas can **learn and reproduce human speech sounds** (despite the very different anatomy of orca vocal organs)<sup>10</sup>. Orcas also imitate natural sounds: field observers have reported wild orcas imitating the calls of other orca groups, the barks of sea lions, and the whistles of dolphins<sup>10</sup>. In one instance, a captive orca housed with bottlenose dolphins learned to produce dolphin-like whistles, essentially “speaking dolphin” with her tank-mates<sup>9</sup>. This **cross-species vocal learning** highlights both their cognitive flexibility and the importance of social environment in shaping orca communication. The ability to imitate is a foundation of any language-like system, and in orcas it underpins the maintenance of dialects and possibly the invention of new calls. Young orcas likely develop their pod’s dialect by mimicking elders<sup>10</sup> – much like human children learn language by imitating adults. Scientists suspect that certain orca sounds even function like **names** or individual identifiers. For example, bottlenose dolphins are known to have “signature whistles” which are unique to each individual (akin to a personal name). Orcas don’t use whistles as much, but they might embed identity information in aspects of their pulsed calls. Some harmonic components of calls could act as an acoustic **badge of identity or origin**, as one researcher speculated, encoding which pod or region an orca belongs to<sup>2,13</sup>. Supporting this, one study found that the two simultaneous tones in many orca calls (so-called *biphonic calls*) can vary independently; this dual-tone design might help orcas recognize who is calling even over long distances or noisy ocean conditions<sup>7</sup>. In essence, orcas may carry an audible group signature in their calls – a striking parallel to human language’s dialects and social identifiers.

Decoding the content of orca communication remains an ongoing challenge, but technology is bringing us closer. Researchers have amassed huge audio libraries of orca sounds (one archive, the **Orchive**, contains over 20,000 hours of recordings<sup>13</sup>). Modern techniques like deep learning are being employed to classify call types and even **match calls to specific individuals or behaviors**<sup>2</sup>. As noted, one lab in Germany has developed **algorithms to automatically detect and classify millions of orca calls** from these archives, a task that would have taken humans decades<sup>13</sup>. They are also creating a system to identify which orca is calling by analyzing time delays on multiple hydrophones and even using photo-ID deep learning to figure out which known whales were present when certain calls were recorded<sup>2</sup>. These advancements, along with innovative fieldwork pairing **drones** and underwater microphones, are allowing scientists to observe what behaviors accompany which calls in unprecedented detail<sup>2</sup>. As Monika Wieland Shields of the Orca Behavior Institute points out, the next big breakthrough will come from correlating the whales’ nuanced social behaviors (often hidden beneath the surface) with their vocalizations<sup>2</sup>. Already, the use of aerial drones has given glimpses of complex underwater interactions during calling bouts, helping to interpret the social context of sounds<sup>2</sup>. All these efforts aim at one goal: to determine if the vocal signals of orcas have specific **meanings or messages** – essentially, to figure out if we can call it a true language. While we aren’t there yet, each discovery (be it consistent call sequences, behavior-predictive calls, or cross-population “translation” of call types) is bringing us closer to understanding the **intricacies of orca communication**.

## Recent Advances and Ongoing Research  
**Research in the 2020s** has accelerated our understanding of orcas’ intelligence and communication, thanks to new technology and some surprising natural observations. One major development is the use of **machine learning and AI** in bioacoustics. In 2021–2022, scientists introduced systems like *ORCA-SPOT* and *ORCA-SLANG*, which apply deep neural networks to recognize orca call types and even discover new vocal patterns from large datasets<sup>2,13</sup>. These tools have greatly improved call classification and made it possible to analyze years of recordings in a short time. Building on this, the 2023 study by Sandholm (referenced earlier) took a supervised-learning approach to link calls with observed behaviors, reporting very high success in predicting what the whales were doing from sound alone<sup>1</sup>. Such findings fuel the exciting idea that we might eventually detect semantic elements in orca vocalizations – for example, distinct call combinations that reliably mean “let’s hunt” versus “I’m distressed” or other conditions.

Another cutting-edge project is seeking to **decode orca dialects**. The Pattern Recognition Lab team from Germany (Friedrich-Alexander University) has been conducting field expeditions in the Northeast Pacific, recording entire social contexts of orca pods<sup>13</sup>. By combining **spectrogram analysis** (visualizing calls) with direct behavioral observations (often assisted by drones and synchronized video), they hope to crack the code of what orcas are “saying” to each other<sup>2,13</sup>. They are also tackling the challenge of attributing calls to *individuals*, which is difficult since orcas often vocalize underwater out of sight. New underwater microphone arrays and photo-ID algorithms now allow researchers to know *which specific whale* made a call and what that whale was doing at the time<sup>2</sup>. This is a crucial piece in understanding how communication works in a complex group – it might reveal, for instance, if certain important calls are typically made by the matriarch or by juveniles, or if some individuals serve as “sentinels” that announce threats.

Field observations in recent years have also revealed **remarkable new behaviors underscoring orca intelligence**. In addition to the resurrection of the “salmon hat” play behavior in late 2024<sup>15</sup>, perhaps the most unexpected trend has been the interactions between orcas and boats in the Iberian Peninsula region. Starting around 2020, groups of orcas off Spain and Portugal began deliberately bumping, pushing, and even disabling sailboats (often targeting the rudders). This behavior, though dangerous for both whales and humans, appears to be *socially learned* – possibly originating from a female nicknamed White Gladis and spreading to other orcas over time. Some experts, including Shields from OBI, have speculated it could be another form of **orca fad or play**, albeit a destructive one, given that it seems to occur in bursts and spread among connected individuals<sup>15</sup>. Others think it might be a defensive response or misdirected curiosity. In either case, it highlights orcas’ capacity to **quickly adopt new behaviors** through social learning. Scientists are closely studying this phenomenon to understand the motivation and to ensure both whale and human safety. It serves as a potent reminder that orcas have **culture in real time** – they can invent and disseminate behaviors within a population.

On the neuroscience front, research is ongoing to map orca brain function in detail. MRI studies are creating 3D atlases of the orca brain to see which areas are enlarged relative to other species<sup>3</sup>. Already, we know the orca’s **insular cortex** (involved in emotion and social cognition) is notably expanded, possibly explaining their capacity for empathy and social intuition. Scientists like Lori Marino emphasize that many measures of brain development (like the number of cortical folds and presence of specialized cells) show orca brains **meet or exceed those of humans** in certain respects<sup>5</sup>,. For example, the latest analyses of their auditory system confirm the earlier finding that they have *two* separate pathways from ear to brain – one likely evolved to handle high-frequency echolocation data and one for lower-frequency social sounds<sup>5</sup>. Understanding these adaptations helps explain how orcas can process complex soundscape information so rapidly.

Finally, conservation-focused research in the 2020s is blending with intelligence studies. Knowing that orcas have such rich social structures and learned traditions has concrete implications for their protection. Agencies like NOAA and groups like Wild Orca have pointed out that losing even a few key individuals (say an experienced matriarch or a popular “riff leader” whale with unique knowledge) could mean the loss of vital cultural knowledge for that pod. Thus, efforts to protect not just orca numbers but **orca culture** have gained traction. Recognizing, for instance, that Southern Resident orcas culturally specialize on Chinook salmon has spurred initiatives to rebuild salmon runs – effectively to save the whales’ way of life. Likewise, the documentation of orca grief and deep social bonds<sup>12</sup>, has influenced public sentiment and policy around keeping orcas in captivity. Many now argue that confining such emotionally and socially complex animals is unethical, which has led to calls for marine sanctuaries and an end to theatrical orca shows. Our growing scientific understanding of orca intelligence strengthens these arguments by confirming that orcas experience something analogous to human emotions and family ties.

In summary, recent research continues to affirm that orcas rank among the **most intelligent, socially sophisticated, and communicative species** on the planet. Their brains are wired for advanced cognition and rich emotional experiences; their societies have culture and cooperation rivaling those of primates or elephants; and their vocal communication is multifaceted, possibly edging toward a true language in complexity. Ongoing studies – leveraging new technologies from AI pattern recognition to drones – are steadily unraveling the mysteries of orca communication and cognition. Each discovery not only amazes scientists and the public, but also highlights the need to respect and protect these extraordinary creatures. Orcas remind us that we are not alone in possessing intelligence, culture, and empathy: in the oceans swims a black-and-white “second society” that we are just beginning to truly understand,. The hope is that as we learn more about orcas’ inner lives and languages, it will inspire stronger conservation actions and a deeper appreciation for the richness of life beyond our own species.
